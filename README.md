# Computer-Vision--DCGAN

GANS are designed to create realistic-looking images. It consists of a generator and a discriminator network. The generator network would try to create realistic-looking images from random noise. The duty of the discriminator is pretty simple. All it has to do is to verify if an image is real or fake.

The ideal goal of this method is to train the generator network very well so that the discriminator will be fooled by the fake images created by the generator and make the generator believe that it is a real image.
